## 📚  AcadexaVault  
### PHINMA–University of Pangasinan Academic Repository System

AcadexaVault is a web-based system that we created for PHINMA–University of Pangasinan. It serves as a digital archive where students and faculty can upload and access research papers, theses, and other academic works.

This project is one of our major requirements.

---

## 🧠 Background

Nowadays, students from Senior High School to College are required to create research papers as part of their academic requirements. But most of these works are stored in flash drives, folders, or computers — and eventually get lost or forgotten.

Our idea is to create a system where these papers can be safely stored, properly organized, and easily searched by others — even in the future. This will help preserve and showcase the research output of our school community.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Collect and store research papers in one place  
- Help users find papers easily through search and filters  
- Make it easier for the school to manage and showcase academic work  
- Provide access to papers for students, teachers, and even outside users

## 👥 Who Can Use This System

- Students who want to upload or search for papers  
- Faculty members who guide or submit research  
- Admins who manage the system and monitor usage  
- Visitors or researchers looking for local studies

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

We used the WAMP stack because it's easy to set up and works well for our project:

- Windows (OS)  
- Apache (Web Server)  
- MySQL (Database)  
- PHP (Backend – native, no frameworks)  
- XamppServer for local hosting  
- phpMyAdmin to manage the database

---

## 🖥️ How to Run the Project (Local Setup)

1. Install XAMPP on your computer.
2. Copy the project folder into: C:/xampp/htdocs/ (or C:/xampp64/htdocs/ if you installed XAMPP in that directory)
3. Open phpMyAdmin by going to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser.
4. Create a new database (e.g., acadexavault).
5. Import the provided .sql file into your new database.
6. Edit config.php and update the database credentials if necessary (e.g., DB name, username, password).
7. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.
8. Run the system by visiting: http://localhost/acadexavault
